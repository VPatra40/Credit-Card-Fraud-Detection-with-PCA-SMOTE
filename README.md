**Credit Card Fraud Detection using PCA & SMOTE**
Credit card fraud is a major real-world problem. Out of 284,807 transactions, only 492 are fraudulent (~0.17%), which makes this a highly imbalanced dataset. While traditional models achieve high accuracy, they often fail to detect rare fraud cases.

This project applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to balance the dataset, improving fraud detection performance.
